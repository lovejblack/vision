Vision operates on the five second rule. 
the more valuable a thing is: [the higher the VALUE]=[the quicker the response to the drop](relative to when/where it drops)
vision algorithm responds to the whole's reaction to the drop.
  vision algorithm recognizes [a drop can be ahead or behind its time] and adjuststs.
